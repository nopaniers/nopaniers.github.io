    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week, Tony Abbott, Australian prime minister presented his <a href="http://www.budget.gov.au/2014-15/content/overview/html/overview_key_initiatives.htm">harsh budget</a>. Some pretty drastic measures were taken to get our federal budget under control, including slashing foreign aid ($7.6 billion) cutting school funding ($30 billion), increasing the interest on student loans, a $7 fee for visiting the doctor (currently free), cuts to hospital funding ($50 billion over 8 years), smaller social security payments, particularly for those under 30, increasing the retirement age to 70, and reducing funding ($1.3 billion) to senior&rsquo;s concessions and cutting investment and research into renewable energy.</p>

<p>The cuts were deep.</p>

<p>But he cuts aren&rsquo;t even in the best interest of the country. Cutting research and investment in renewable energy, schools, and universities are cuts to Australia&rsquo;s future. It is a cut to the very people whose hard work will have to support an aging population.</p>

<p>There are better ways.</p>

<p><strong>Mandatory detention centres</strong></p>

<p>The Department of Immigration and Citizenship estimates that the cost of mandatory detention to the Australian taxpayer is approximately <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/about/reports/budget/budget12/_paes-pdf/1213-paes-full.pdf">$2.1 billion per year</a>. That doesn&rsquo;t include the cost of capital expenditure, to build new centres in the coming few years &ndash; some <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/policy/nauru-detention-rebuild-costs-dwarfs-resorts/story-fn9hm1gu-1226256685006">$316 million</a> for a centre in Nauru, and <a href="http://expertpanelonasylumseekers.dpmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/report/attachment_11_likely_cost_of_recommendations.pdf">$230 million for Manus Island</a>. Imprisoning people is expensive, and we lock up assylum seekers in the most out of the way places possible. <a href="http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?docid=4dc935fd2">UNHCR estimates</a> that community processing is around <strong>10 times</strong> cheaper.</p>

<p>But more importantly, imprisoning people who have committed no crime is <em>wrong</em>. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/30533/">Amnesty International</a> describes it as</p>

<blockquote><p>The unlawful and arbitrary detention of these men in such destitute conditions is cruel, inhumane and degrading.</p></blockquote>

<p>Going on to describe the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1038-5282.2003.02023.x/abstract;jsessionid=BEC62031F33F43145158DA5B027D52D8.f01t01?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false">terrible human toll</a> it is having</p>

<blockquote><p>The news that five years could be the wait time for these men under the Government’s ‘no advantage’ policy added insult to injury, with one man attempting to take his life on Wednesday night.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mandatory is also an international embarrassment to Australia. Even <a href="http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/02/21/china-joins-criticism-australian-asylum-policy">China and Iran</a> have critisized us for it, particularly our mandatory detention of children.</p>

<p>By doing away with the cruel and inhumane practise of mandatory detention, we would save $8 billion over four years.</p>
