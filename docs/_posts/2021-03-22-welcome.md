After becoming pretty disillusioned wiith social media, such as [Facebook](facebook.com), [Reddit](reddit.com) and [Twitter](twitter.com), I have decided to start a blog. The aim is to write about the things that interest me in more depth than 250 characters allows. 

So what does interest me?

- [Quantum computing](arxiv.org) (physics and maths more generally)
- Automating all the things
- Improving Melbourne's West
- [International relations](https://www.globaldispatchespodcast.com/)
- The intersection between faith and reason

I hope you find some of the things I write helpful.
