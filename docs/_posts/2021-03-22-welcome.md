After becoming pretty disillusioned wiith social media, such as [Facebook](facebook.com), [Reddit](reddit.com) and [Twitter](twitter.com), I have decided to start a blog. The aim is to write about interesting things in more depth than 250 characters allows. 

So what does interest me?

- Quantum computing (physics and maths more generally)
- Automating all the things
- Improving Melbourne's West
- International relations
- The intersection between faith and reason 

I'm not really qualified to write about any of these except for quantum computing, but when did that ever stop anyone on the Internet?
