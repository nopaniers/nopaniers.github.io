Burma lies in turmoil. Along with other democratically elected leaders, Nobel Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi has [been arrested](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-55882489), and the military has seized control. Today, it's with sadness that we [saw](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-03-28/myanmar-five-year-old-among-almost-100-killed-security-forces/100033752) more than 90 people, including children shot dead. 

Apart from my horror at the denial of basic democratic rights and the violence, a strange angle which has stuck out to me is the media's coverage of events.

First there was a viral video of an aerobics instructor dancing, while the military rolled in to take control in the background.

The woman dances to "Ampun Bang Jago" which (according to the Jakarta Post) translates as something like "Ease up, Mr Hotshot" - a protest song against authority. Some people have suggested the video is photoshopped, given some of the shadows. Personally, it looks real to me, but whether it is or isn't, either way viral social media spread these surreal pictures around the world.
